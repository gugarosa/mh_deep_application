# Meta-Heuristic Deep Application: A Lecture on Nature-Inspired Optimization Applied to Deep Learning

Meta-Heuristic Deep Application provides a thorough lecture on nature-inspired otpimization applied to deep learning architectures to be given at "5ª Escola Avançada em Big Data Analytics - ICMC/USP". Apart from the lecture itself, we also implemented a wide variety of tasks to illustrate how one can use such tools in real-world applications.

## Guidelines

1. Every needed piece of information is elucidated in this **README**;
2. **Installation** is also straightforward and well-explained;
3. If there is a problem, please do not **hesitate** and call us.

## Installation

The installation process is straightforward as the dependencies are listed on the `requirements.txt` file. One can install them under the most preferred Python environment (raw, conda, virtualenv):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Additionally, the source files for the lecture are presented in LaTeX. Thus, one might need an additional compiler or even Overleaf to build the files into a PDF file.

## Getting Started

This section provides an overview of the text augmentation lecture, as well as three text augmentation applications.

### Lecture

The lecture is written in Portuguese in a slide-based format. The contents are available at the `slides` folder and can be compiled to PDF using a LaTeX compiler.
